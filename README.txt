This is the code to reproduce the analyses of Orben and Przybylski (2018), The association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use, Nature Human Behaviour.

The code is split into different subscripts, each split for analyses of the three different datasets (1. YRBS, 2. MTF, 3. MCS):
1. Preparing the data
2. Running the SCA (but R code and .run files for running on computer cluster)
3. Analysing the SCA
4. Doing the bootstrapping tests
5. Doing the comparison SCAs
6. Plotting the SCAs
7. Plotting the comparison SCAs

You can find .rda files of the SCAs and comparison SCAs on the OSF. Furthermore the bootstrapping test results can also be found on the OSF: https://osf.io/e84xu/
